# Best practices

## Function composition

Create "utility" functions that can be called from
any other function

Examples:

* Setup skybox / background music
* Teleport player back to specific position
* Cleanup contraptions (remove objects, etc)

## Documentations

Always label your functions/blocks
I recommend pyrollo's [display_modpack](https://github.com/pyrollo/display_modpack) for that
